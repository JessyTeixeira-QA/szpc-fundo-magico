**Magic Background** is an interactive application that uses Artificial Intelligence to transform textual descriptions into animated and stylized backgrounds in real-time. The project combines the power of **Front-end** development with the flexibility of automation via **n8n**.

## 📋 About the Project

This project was developed during the **Semana do Zero ao Programador Contratado (SZPC)**. The core idea is to allow users to describe a scenario or style (e.g., *"a space gradient with shooting stars"*) and the AI automatically generates the necessary HTML and CSS code to create that visual effect, applying it instantly to the page background.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Prompt-to-Style:** Generation of animations and styles based on natural language descriptions.
- **Real-Time Preview:** Dynamic CSS injection into the DOM for immediate visualization.
- **Code Display:** Shows the HTML and CSS code generated by the AI so it can be copied and used in other projects.
- **Responsive Design:** Interface adapted for different screen sizes (Mobile and Desktop).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Animations)
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Integration & Backend:**
  - [n8n](https://n8n.io/) (Low-code automation platform)
  - Google Gemini AI (Language model for code generation)
  - Fetch API for asynchronous communication

## ⚙️ Workflow Configuration (n8n)

For the project to work, an n8n workflow must be configured as follows:

1. **Webhook Node:** Receives the user's prompt via POST method.
2. **AI Agent / Google Gemini:** Processes the text and generates a JSON object containing `html` and `css` keys.
3. **Code Node:** Cleans the AI response, ensuring only pure code is returned (removing markdown blocks).
4. **Respond to Webhook:** Returns the processed data to the frontend.

## 🔧 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JessyTeixeira-QA/szpc-fundo-magico.git
```

### 2. Configure the API URL
In the `src/js/index.js` file, locate the URL constant and replace it with your n8n webhook endpoint:
```javascript
const response = await fetch("YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE", { ... });
```

### 3. Run the Project
You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser or use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code for a better development experience.
